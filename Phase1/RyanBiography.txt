I am a student in the Software Engineering Specialist in University of Toronto Scarborough 3rd year. Last five years, I have learned 7 programming languages such as Python, Turing and Java etc. I am able to operate on MS Windows, Unix systems and fully adapt at Microsoft Office suite. I am fluent in speaking, reading and writing Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. Also, I am good at teamwork and problem solving that could help me participate well in my team. In this team, I am following the agile process to refine our groups programming in order to reach the clients requirement. I always use all my knowledge and experience to create fully working software. I like facing challenges in programming that improve my skills and enhance my abilities. In my spare time I would like to searching the new technology stuff, play LOL(league of legends) and snowboarding.
