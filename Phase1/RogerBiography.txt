I am Xiang Wang, a third year co-op student specializing in Computer Science at the University of Toronto Scarborough. Through my focus and determination at university, I have become proficient in designing and developing projects using programing languages such as C, Java and Python, and great at using several programming tools like Eclipse, Android SDK, and Apache Maven. In addition to my academic achievements, I also developed strong skills such as teamwork, problem-solving and communication, which enhanced my capacity to face varied challenges under any circumstances. As a Technical Systems Analyst at RBC Capital Markets, I worked with a Global Risk Architect to investigate, analyze and use the latest technology to prototype new business solutions. In my spare time, I enjoy music and sports, and also like learning about new technology (such as mobile software and hardware) through online research and books, and making use of them in daily life.
