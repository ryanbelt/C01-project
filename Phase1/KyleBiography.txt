Hi, I'm Kyle Bridgemohansingh a 2nd year Computer Science student, with a major interest in Software Engineering at the University of Toronto. I grew up with computers so the natural path was for me to venture into software engineering. When I was in elementary school I experimented with HTML and CSS creating websites for fun and ad revenue. Other than that most of my programming occured while enrolled at UTSC. I’m most comfortable with Python and Java although I’m familiar with other languages. I have experience with test driven development, agile work environments, debugging, recursion and version control. I like working both independently and in a team, and I’m always eager to contribute what I can. My analytical and problem-solving skills have been proven by graduation from the International Baccalaureate program along with many school assignments. Coupled with my technical skills I also have a solid set of interpersonal skills which will make me a valuable asset to any team. I'm a third degree black belt, and some of my hobbies include hip-hop and competitive gaming.
