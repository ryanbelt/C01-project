Hi, I am a 2nd year student in the Computer Science Specialist Program with primary focus on the Software Engineering Stream. Having a high enthusiasm and dedication in computer science, I have gained experience with programming in diverse environments. Moreover, I personally developed analytical and problem-solving skills that allow me to transcend my own potential in the field of computer science. Over the years, my knowledge in programming has been rapidly increasing as I have taken programming courses, practiced through self-study, and been involved in clubs and competitions such as Canadian Computing Competition and Hackathon. Moreover, I have exhibited a solid understanding in programming languages such as Python, Java and C. I am familiar with major programming concepts such as recursion and Object Oriented Programming. I love to keep myself up-to-date with technology through websites like Engadget. My hobbies include playing soccer, video games, and building useful scripts just for fun.
