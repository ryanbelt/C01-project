								</header>
								<a class="image centered"><img src="images/ResearcherPic.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60% !important"/></a>
								<p><br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								Dr. Aaron N. Harris is a linguistic anthropologist researcher. He is friendly and easy-
								going. He is very interested in his research making him a driven individual in his field. He
								is married and has a son (age 3), and spends a lot of his time at the University or at home
								on his computer. He brings lunch most of the days but occasionally eats out. He spends a
								lot of his time reading about Israel in the Middle East. After putting his son to bed he is
								able to relax and surf the web casually. He recently had his 28th birthday, and celebrated
								it by staying home with his wife and son.<br><br>

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								Dr. Harris finished his joint-PHD in Anthropology and Linguistics from the University
								of Arizona in 2009. He currently works at the University of Toronto as an Assistant
								Professor of Anthropology. His specialities include anthropology focusing on linguistics,
								communication and language, and the Middle East. He spends a few hours a day focusing
								on his teaching and administrative tasks at the University. His students are mostly
								undergraduate students, but also teaches a couple of graduate students.He also spends
								the rest of his working day keeping up to date on current conflicts in the Middle East
								reading sources such as 'Al Jazeer English'.<br><br>

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								A typical day for Dr. Harris starts early. He reads 'Al Jazzer English' and similar
								sources on his computer while grabbing a coffee and breakfast at his local coffee shop.
								He tries to eat healthy, but every friday he decides to treat himself to a sweet chocolate-
								covered danish. He arrives at the University around 8:00am on mornings when he needs
								to go to work. The classes he teaches are usually scheduled from somewhere in between
								9:00am and 12:00pm. He is very relaxed and is excited to help his students with any
								questions, concerns or queries they may have. If he makes a mistake he can easily admit
								to it, and readily apologizes if someone corrects him. Once his last class is done he will
								grab lunch either with friends or by himself. If the former occurs he will take his laptop out
								and check twitter for any updates that might catch his interest.<br><br>

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								Dr. Harris has Windows 7 installed on his day to day laptop. He hasn't upgraded to
								Windows 8 yet as he finds the 'metro' interface intimidating. As a researcher he is very
								familiar with Microsoft Office and similar type applications. He carries an Android phone,
								and frequently emails, texts, and checks updates from current social media websites such
								as Facebook and Twitter. He prefers to see data portrayed visually such as through trees
								and charts rather than numbers.<br><br>

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
								Although Dr. Harris is not the most technological-savvy person in his department
								he never gets frustrated when he doesn't understand how to do certain tasks on the
								computer. Instead he will ask questions and try to learn from the people around him. He
								is extremely passionate about his work in anthropology and actively tries to share it with
								the people around him.
