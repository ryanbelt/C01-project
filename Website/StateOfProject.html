									<b>(Nov 26, 2014)</b>
									<br><br>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Team Acme’s goals for Phase Four was to refine the system we have built in previous phases, as well as creating a presentable system. For this Phase we had two iterations planned which were all features that needed to be built on top of the previous features from our previous iterations. Iteration Plan 4 focused on user stories numbered 3, 9, 15 and 19. These user stories were key to creating a presentable and working software system. All of these user stories had a medium priorities, which was the highest of the priorities we had left. Our second iteration plan focused on the user stories numbered 6, 10 and 20. These were low priority user stories which we saw to be features that were not necessary, but would be nice to have. We decided to work on this last, so that we at least had the necessary features by the end of our last Iteration. However, before we could start working on our new iterations we had to overcome some obstacles.<br><br>

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									After our Phase Three interview we realised that there were a few things that we had to solve first. In out twitter and article explorer we needed to change the way we handled the functions defined as get_sources. We wanted this to return both the source given, as well at the specific url where the source was matched. In twitter explorer we decided that the current method get_tweets was giving us some trouble, so we decided to redo that, and our new method turned out to be a huge improvement over our old one. Lastly we realised that we had the wrong idea for getting influence. Originally we had the user pick the influence for articles, but we now have realised that’s not what our users want. Now the influence is calculated rather than selected.<br><br>

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Now that we have improved our current system we can begin working on iterations 4 and 5. As previously mention Iteration Plan 4 focused on building a presentable, working and refined version of our software. We started Iteration 4 at the end of our Iteration 3, on Nov 13. After working and completing user stories numbered 3, 9, 15, and 19 by the iteration due date of Nov 19, we began working on Iteration 5. Iteration 5 ended on Nov 26. We completed 2 of our 3 user stories (numbered 6 and 10). However we didn’t complete user story 20, luckily this was a low priority, and extra feature. So we were comfortable leaving it uncompleted. Overall we are very happy with our progress through our two iteration plans this phase.
									<br><br>

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									By the end of our last iteration we have completed 21 of our 22 user stories, only leaving an extra feature with a low priority. Our software is clean, presentable and working and is documented well throughout the code as well as in our Read Me documentation. We believe that our software exceeds the expectations of our users and clients. We presented our software to Krista and she had the following things to say, “Thanks so much for meeting today, and showing off your group’s impressive application. I cannot think of another feature Alejandro or I would want, and indeed, this exceeds my expectations for a feature set.” With the words of encouragement from Krista, we are confident that our other client Alejandro will be happy with the software we’ve designed for him. We believe that the librarian programmer will be able to use and change our software as we have kept it modular. Lastly we feel that it is easy to use, so that the graduate students will have little to no trouble getting it to work.

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									For Team Acme, Phase Three was about building on top of the base that we had programmed for our system during Phase Two. Along with that Phase Three was also about maintaining and improving code from Phase Two. In Phase Two we overlooked some of the practical elements of demonstrating software to a client. In this Phase we have fixed this, by beginning to work on a practical user interface which a Researcher could use. We started this phase by starting a new iteration and picking relevant user stories. This phase had a total of two iterations (#2 and #3). Iteration #2 focused on user stories which were relevant to how data would be handled, and making it easy for us to access later so that we could use them in analysis and visualizations. We started this iteration on November 1st and ended on November 6th with an aim of completing 3 user stories (#2, 7, 5) for a total of 10 hours of cost. We chose a low amount of cost for this iteration, as we had to also consider other responsibilities such as midterms.<br><br>

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									However, before we could begin working on Iteration #2, we needed to improve on our CRC model. In the beginning our CRC model lacked walkthroughs, and were not very modular. However, as you can see in our new CRC Cards, we now have planned walkthroughs which create a modular system for our software. For example “view visualizations” from django_ui, will call “tweet_visualize” or “article_visualize” from visualizer, which would then call functions from django_db in order to complete the request. We now believe that we have a firm CRC model that will help us continue towards the rest of the project. We also decided to discontinue our use with pyMongo and switch to SQLite3 as it is required for what we want to do with django.<br><br>

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Now that we have updated the guide for the software we were able to move on with Iteration #2 and complete the specified user stories. In our Iteration Plans, one can see that Iteration #2 handled only Librarian and Library Programmer user stories. Next we moved onto Iteration #3; This Iteration would be mainly handling the Researcher user stories. We wanted to start working on the content which would be seen in a user interface. Such as sorting, searching, logging in, and viewing data. These user stories also had high priority, and were important to future features of our software, including switching visualization and allowing Researchers to see the data in a presentable matter. We also wanted to work on being able to halt the program, in case of an emergency. Unfortunately we over estimated our time, and were unable to complete user stories 18 and 4, when we originally set out to the 6 user stories (#4, 11, 12, 16, 17 and 18).  We began on November 7th and ended November 13th with a cost of We plan to continue working on these stores in our next iteration.
									<br><br>

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Like any project we had our obstacles. One of them was getting pyMongo to work with django, unfortunately we couldn’t achieve this. So we decided to move on SQLite3 as previously mentioned. Another obstacle we had was updating our CRC model to be modular. In one of our semi-weekly meetings we discussed how we would improve it, and went about making new CRC cards to represent our new CRC model. Overall we found Phase 3 to be a success. Iteration #2 went smoothly and although there were some hiccups in Iteration #3 we believe that we still have a sufficient amount of time to complete the tasks in future iterations. Even though we could not completely follow our Iteration Plan #3, we feel that we have efficiently set up the pathway for the rest of our Iterations. Also, we believe that we have made good use of our GitHub repository, as all users have contributed and have committed with good messages. We look forward to moving on with the rest of our project in the same manner.

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									For Team Acme, Phase Two was about building a strong base for our system and improving our Phase One. Phase One was a planning process where our team decided on what things we are looking for in the final project. We created two personas, a librarian and a researcher. However, this was not enough; there were two other users who may use the system so it was important to include them. With the addition of librarian programmer and research assistant personas came new and changed user stories. We made the user stories more clear and testable. There were also other minor changes we made along the way, such as cleaning up our introductions.
									Our team has 2-3 face-to-face meetings weekly, allowing us to be very agile in our development process. We are constantly able to talk to each other about the development process and assist each other if needed. This also allowed us to iterate over changes as a team. When we couldn't meet in person we would discuss project related work using the mobile app WhatsApp with a quick reply policy. This allowed us to get information as quick as possible from the other members in our group.<br><br>

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									For Phase Two, we were mainly building upon some of the user stories that we had come up with for the librarian and researcher during Phase One. We chose Python as our programming language because we were able to find all the API's necessary for the system to be fully compatible with Python. Then, we focused on setting up a database using MongoDB to store any data we might need, such as tweet or article data. We also began implementing functions to web scrape news sites using newspaper API, along with using a Python based Twitter API to search tweets and get information from users. We also created CRC cards that we needed now and in the forecasted future of the project. Moving forward we will need to start looking at a way to analyze and come up with statistics based on the data we scrape from articles and tweets. Along with that we will need to start testing functions with sample sources and sites to see if our methods for this project is appropriate.<br><br>

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Like any project, there were problems and obstacles that our team had to overcome. The first problem we ran into was choosing a language to develop in. Our team was a little split, so we decided to try and look for a language with a lot of libraries, which were relevant to the project. Then, our decision came down to Python. After finding what libraries were available we decided to use Python 2.7.x due to compatibility issues. One obstacle we still have is working with WARC files, as we have not found a library that is consistent in its formatting when creating WARC files. We have thought of alternatives, however we are still constantly looking for anything that can help us work with WARC files. <br><br>

									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									Overall, we believe that Phase Two has been a success. We feel that we are keeping up with our re-evaluated release plan, user stories and personas. We have successfully begun the full implementation of our article, and tweet scraping functions with the help of newspaper and Tweepy libraries, along with setting up a database with PyMongo. We have completed most of the user stories from our iteration plan that includes User Story #1, 2, 5, 8, 13, 14, 21, 22. Our Iteration Plan is only left with the User Story #6 which is due to the fact that the Priority of it is Low and the Cost for implementing it is 3 days. Even though we could not completely follow our Iteration Plan, We feel that we have efficiently set up the pathway for the rest of our Iterations. Also, we believe that we have made good use of our GitHub repository, as all users have contributed and have committed with good messages. We look forward to moving on with the rest of our project in the same manner.
