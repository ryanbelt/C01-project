									<h2>JAI SUGHAND</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Hi, I am a 2nd year student in the Computer Science Specialist Program with primary focus on the Software Engineering Stream. Having a high enthusiasm and dedication in computer science, I have gained experience with programming in diverse environments. Moreover, I personally developed analytical and problem-solving skills that allow me to transcend my own potential in the field of computer science. Over the years, my knowledge in programming has been rapidly increasing as I have taken programming courses, practiced through self-study, and been involved in clubs and competitions such as Canadian Computing Competition and Hackathon. Moreover, I have exhibited a solid understanding in programming languages such as Python, Java and C. I am familiar with major programming concepts such as recursion and Object Oriented Programming. I love to keep myself up-to-date with technology through websites like Engadget. My hobbies include playing soccer, video games, and building useful scripts just for fun.</p>

									<h2>KYLE BRIDGEMOHANSINGH</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Hi, I'm Kyle Bridgemohansingh a 2nd year Computer Science student, with a major interest in Software Engineering at the University of Toronto. I grew up with computers so the natural path was for me to venture into software engineering. When I was in elementary school I experimented with HTML and CSS creating websites for fun and ad revenue. Other than that most of my programming occured while enrolled at UTSC. I’m most comfortable with Python and Java although I’m familiar with other languages. I have experience with test driven development, agile work environments, debugging, recursion and version control. I like working both independently and in a team, and I’m always eager to contribute what I can. My analytical and problem-solving skills have been proven by graduation from the International Baccalaureate program along with many school assignments. Coupled with my technical skills I also have a solid set of interpersonal skills which will make me a valuable asset to any team. I'm a third degree black belt, and some of my hobbies include hip-hop and competitive gaming.

									<h2>YUYA IWABUCHI</h2>
								</header>
								<p>My name is Yuya Iwabuchi, and I am a third year computer science specialist at University of Toronto Scarborough. As a computer science student, I have been intrigued with programming for more than four years, and I have become highly proficient in programming and scripting languages such as Python, Java, C, and Shell. In addition to coding, I have interest in hardware and other technologies, which made me follow technology news sites and build custom computers. Earlier this year, I was working at TELUS communication for 4 months co-op program, where I have gained real experience and confidence to work with other team members. With significant working hours expected from this course and project, it will be challenging for us to accomplish, but I believe that my experiences and skills will be valuable to complete this project. In my spare time I like to play squash, video games and work on small projects along with my friends.</p>

									<h2>XIANG (ROGER) WANG</h2>
								</header>
								<p >I am Xiang Wang, a third year co-op student specializing in Computer Science at the University of Toronto Scarborough. Through my focus and determination at university, I have become proficient in designing and developing projects using programing languages such as C, Java and Python, and great at using several programming tools like Eclipse, Android SDK, and Apache Maven. In addition to my academic achievements, I also developed strong skills such as teamwork, problem-solving and communication, which enhanced my capacity to face varied challenges under any circumstances. As a Technical Systems Analyst at RBC Capital Markets, I worked with a Global Risk Architect to investigate, analyze and use the latest technology to prototype new business solutions. In my spare time, I enjoy music and sports, and also like learning about new technology (such as mobile software and hardware) through online research and books, and making use of them in daily life.</p>
