pros.
1. good function output as we have in group discussed
2. good comment and doc string to go through. Easy understand to keep up
3. variable naming is 	meaningful. eg. tweet_list is easy to get the idea is a list of all tweet object. each object key is tweet ID 
4. test case cover all twitter_explower include the edge cases

cons.

overall.
good code quality. no repeat coding in twitter_explower.
good consistency. follow all we need from group meeting discussion
good maintainbility. meaningful variable naming good docstring, meaningful comment
